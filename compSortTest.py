Implementation of a comprehensive speed test for sorting algorithms.
 Version 1.0
Prerequisites:
  numpy 1.7.0 or later
    Replace lines 53 and 57 with random.randint calls instead of numpy random calls if you don't have it, know this is FAR slower.
Current Features:
  Speed Testing with leaderboard generation over variable size lists
  Options for changing list sizes, number of lists, and others. See docstring of compSortTest for more info.
  Automatic error detection, and notification along with automatic debug list (10 item list) testing for easy debugging.
Future Features:
  Options for pathological data (sorted lists, almost sorted lists, lists with high repetition, near reversed lists, etc.)
  Better automatic debugging with pathological data options and more helpful errors.
    Where was the problem in the large list? Where they the same length? etc.
Current bugs:
  None (known, please make a pull request or email me if you find one)
Past bugs:
  Bad sorts break the leaderboard by making consequent sorts not test for the list that the broken sort failed on.
    Branch: Issue-1 
    Status: FIXED
    Source: This issue was caused by a subtlety in python "for i in iterable" loops, where deleting something 
            from the iterable causes the loop to skip the next object because it's index has been downshifted 
            without the index of the for loop being changed.

            For more info see the end of 7.3 here: http://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement
